# HBI
Multi-dimensional earthquake cycle simulation code based on Boundary Element Method with H-matrices.

Features

- 2D and 3D planar/nonplanar faults in a full/half space

- Rectangular and triangular meshes for 3D problems (require .stl mesh file for triangular mesh)

- Rate-State friction law (aging, slip, and modified CNS model)

- Fault-zone lienar and nonlinear viscous flow

- Quasi-dynamic approximation using radiation-damping term

- Along-fault fluid pressure diffusion with permeability evolution

- Many examples for input and parameter files

- Hybrid MPI/open-MP parallelization
